jQuery Fundamentals is designed to get you comfortable working through
common problems you'll be called upon to solve using jQuery.
To get the most out of this site, you'll want to read the content *and* try the
various interactive examples. Each chapter will cover a concept and give you a
chance to try example code related to the concept.

We highly recommend using this site with the [Chrome
browser](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) or another browser
that supports modern JavaScript features and includes good developer tools.

### Using the built-in editor
Most pages on this site include a built-in editor where you can try out code.
This code will run against the markup that's displayed in the box to the
right of the editor. To run the code in the editor, click the <i
class="icon-play"></i> button. Reset the results area to its original state
by clicking the <i class="icon-repeat"></i> icon.

### Trying the examples
Each chapter of jQuery Fundamentals includes example code that demonstrates
the concepts being discussed. Click on the <i
class="icon-eye-open"></i> icon in the bar above the example to copy
the example to the editor at the top of the page.
